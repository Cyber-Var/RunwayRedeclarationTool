# Runway Re-declaration Tool

## Introduction

The tool which, given standard runway information and information about an obstacle, provides the revised runway parameters together with a visualisation of the obstacle and a summary of the calculations. 
It can be used to obtain a rapid indication of the effect of an obstruction on the runway parameters as an aid to deciding whether operations can continue.

The tool allows to import airport and runway information in XML format, and export results in XML, JPEG, PNG and TXT formats.
